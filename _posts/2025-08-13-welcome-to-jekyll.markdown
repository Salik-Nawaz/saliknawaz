From my early academic days to my professional work in cleanroom fabrication, my journey in **optoelectronics, photonics, and artificial intelligence (AI)** has been driven by curiosity, precision, and a passion for innovation.

I earned my **Master’s degree in Optoelectronics and Photonics** from the University of Paderborn, Germany. During my studies, I specialized in designing, fabricating, and testing advanced optical and photonic devices — with hands-on experience in **nanochip fabrication**, **VCSEL optimization**, and **quantum technology components**.

Over the past **three years**, I have worked extensively in **cleanroom environments**, focusing on the fabrication of **optoelectronic and photonic components** for cutting-edge quantum technology applications. My work bridges **research**, **practical engineering**, and **AI-based design optimization**, ensuring that concepts not only work in theory but also perform reliably in real-world conditions.

One of my most exciting projects involved **AI-driven optimization of VCSEL (Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser) designs**, where I transitioned from Jupyter notebooks to fully modular Python development. Using machine learning models, I enhanced laser performance parameters, reduced design cycles, and demonstrated how **AI can accelerate photonic device engineering**.

Key highlights of my professional path include:
- Fabricating and testing nanophotonic components in ISO-certified cleanrooms.
- Applying **AI and deep learning** to optimize photonic device designs.
- Contributing to **AIP Advances** with research currently under publication.
- Collaborating in multidisciplinary teams to integrate photonics into innovative technologies.

I believe in the **power of photonics and AI** to transform communication, energy, and computing. As I continue to grow in this field, my goal is to contribute to **next-generation optical systems** that push the boundaries of performance and efficiency.

If you are a recruiter, industry leader, or fellow engineer in **optoelectronics, photonics, AI, or quantum technology**, I’d be happy to connect and explore how my skills can contribute to your projects.
